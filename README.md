Genomic, classes for NRT SC Synthesis + Genetic Algorithms

Code created in conjunction with 2014 EvoMusArt Poster/paper, link TBA. Please note that this software is a very early iteration of the Genomic project, and should be treated as alpha version code and is made public more for educational purposes than anything else.

Genomic depends on Numpy and other libraries. Some classes rely on CorpusDB, by the same author.
